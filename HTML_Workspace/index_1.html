        <h1>My Pancake Recipe</h1>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>For the batter:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <br>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For Serving:</h4>
        <ul>    
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Maple syrup</li>
            <li>Fresh fruit (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>    
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.</li>
            <li>In another bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Do not overmix; it's okay if there are a few lumps.</li>
            <li>Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Lightly grease with butter or cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Pour 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook until <br> bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Flip the pancakes and cook for another 1-2 minutes until golden brown and cooked through.</li>
            <li>Remove from the skillet and keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, greasing the skillet as needed.</li>
            <li>Serve the pancakes warm with butter, maple syrup, and fresh fruit if desired. Enjoy!</li>
